## Dataset

> In this project I performed an exploratory analysis on data provided by Ford GoBike, using Python   visualization techniques. The goal is to find a spesific relationships between some variables that can provide the needed visualization between them .
This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.There are 519700 rows of trip trip in the dataset.



## Summary of Findings

> first : Univariate Exploration In this section, investigate distributions of individual variables.
i have look to distribuation of trip duration and distribuation of user type and distribuation of day.
-Second : Bivariate Exploration In this section, investigate relationships between pairs of variables in 
the dateset I have seen The relationship between user type and weekdays also I have seen The trip duration for the customer type is higher than the subscriber type , I have seen that on july and august users prefer using the bikes for longer trips.
-finally : Multivariate Exploration In this section, investigate relationships between three or more variables. i have seen that  the customer type has the longer trips duration especially in the sunday but the subscriber it is so low and the most highest duration in saturday.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> From that insight the customer ride the bike most than subscribers in the day and have much longer trip duration than subscribers, so we can get benefit from this data to how encourage the subscribers and give some encouragement offer to the customer too.
